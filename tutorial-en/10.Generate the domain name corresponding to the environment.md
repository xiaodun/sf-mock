The form of ip plus port is not easy to distinguish the environment, and it is easy to confuse individual projects, so the program adds the function of generating domain names for each environment, for example: http://wx.test.sf-notes:9011/home/index

This function is only for windows system, it will read the content of "C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts" file, start with "#program-service-start" and "#program-service-end" The content generated by the package program is convenient for later updates, examples are as follows

```
#program-service-start
10.118.0.218 wx.mock.sf-notes
10.118.0.218 wx.test.sf-notes
10.118.0.218 wx.rebuild-test.sf-notes
#program-service-end
```
sf-notes has also done corresponding visualization operations, and the above logic is added in `writeNginxConfig.js`, no additional commands are required
