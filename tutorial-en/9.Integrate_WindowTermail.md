WindowTermail is a multi-window management tool, please refer to the following article for how to use it https://juejin.cn/post/6980363931390836749

Executing `node creatBatForWindowsTerminal.js` will cause the following behavior

- Generate corresponding bat for each project according to the configuration of programConfig.js, there may be multiple

- Generate an allStartProgram.bat that starts all projects, which is convenient for quick project start

- Generate a bat that mocks the server itself

All generated bat files are in the bat folder

## How to configure

````
    "sf-notes": {
      WindowsTerminal: {
        isOpen: true,
        tabList: [
          {
            withCreateAllBat: true,
            withCreateSingleBat: true,
            address: `D:\\github\\sf-notes`,
            startCommad: "npm run dev",
            isSelf: true,
          },
          {
            withCreateAllBat: true,
            withCreateSingleBat: true,
            address: `D:\\github\\sf-notes\\service\\app`,
            startCommad: "node service.js",
            titleName: "notes-service",
          },
        ],
      },
      withFileStructure: false,
      withNginxConfig: false,
    },
````

- isOpen is false will turn off the function, that is, execute `node creatBatForWindowsTerminal.js` to skip the configuration

- withCreateAllBat is false will not participate in the generation of allStartProgram.bat

- address is used to start the address where the project file is located

- startCommad starts the name of the project

- If isSelf is true, the name of the generated bat file is the project name and the name of the tab page, and other configurations under the tabList will be combined into one

- titleName generates the name of the bat file, which is also the name of the tab. For the webpack project tab, the name will be overwritten with npm, and no solution has been found yet.
