There are the following configurations in copySwaggerConfig.js

````
 isOpen: false,
````

Before opening, also pay attention to some configuration

**getDocLink**

The return value of the function is the address of the swagger document, just provide the domain name and port number

**getMatchUrl**

The mock server will use the requested url to match the interface pulled from swagger. There may be differences between the two places. For example, swagger does not have some common prefixes.

This method can handle the above problem

**transformRspData**

swagger returns only the most basic data, but for different projects, there will be some unified outer structure.

This method can do some adaptation

**getMockStructure**

The result returned by this method is for writing to sf-notes-mock-api.js and usually does not require additional processing

After everything is configured properly

````
 isOpen: true,
````

Then restart the mock server, after that each api that is not recorded in sf-notes-mock-api.js will go to the swagger documentation to find it again.

## ajaxStructureConfigData

Usually, the interface on the swagger document is mapped to the project. This script is used for batch generation and can be localized according to the comments in the file

- moduleName This is the category name of the interface, and the interface under this category will be processed by the program
- reqUrl can get this address through developer tools, for example "http://wenwo-cloud-adapter-doctor-rebuild-dev.wenwo.cn/v2/api-docs?group=background-admin", the program will request This address, so as to obtain all interface description information under the group
- An item stored in configList.push is an interface in moduleName

- result Here is the unified processing of configList, the content in it determines the processing logic, because the program puts objects by default, so this is just to put the generated information into the js array
