# start up

Clone the project locally, run `npm install`, then execute `node mockService.js`

Successful startup will output "http://[localhost IPV4 address]:9192"

If port 9192 is occupied, open `serviceConfig.js` and modify startPort

# experience

Enter "localhost:9192/example/api/simple/object" in the browser

will get the output

````
{
    message: "Ordinary object",
    color: "red"
}
````

Chrome browser recommends installing JSON Viewer, you can better view the return

Where 'example' is the project name, which is built-in by the program for the convenience of demonstration

'/api/simple/object' is the requested path, open "example-mock-api.js",

````
    "/api/simple/object": {
      body: {
        message: "Ordinary object",
        color: "red",
      },
    },
````

Change the 'color' property to 'green'

````
    "/api/simple/object": {
      body: {
        message: "Ordinary object",
        color: "green",
      },
    },
````

Refresh your browser to see the effect

In fact, you can add any content after example, such as "http://localhost:9192/example/1"

'example-mock-api.js' would add

````
    "/1": {
      useDirMode: true,
    },
````

At the same time create '1.js', the content is

````
(function () {
  return (data) => {
    return { status: 200, data: {} };
  };
})();

````
